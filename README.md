# Intro to UX Workshop [Old Project]

## Background

I found this workshop helpful to the public a while back, based on the feedback I received; therefore, I am sharing it with anyone who may come across this.

I was in high school, conjuring design research-related experiments at the time. I developed a deep concern for people in various cultural and environmental contexts and settings following a range of experiences, including witnessing how my grandparents, who had mobility issues, interacted with scissors and discussing and reading extensively on design frameworks, such as those by [Don Norman](https://jnd.org/about-don-norman/latest-updates/). Design has been and continues to be about improving lives and solving problems.

Someone reached out to me and asked if I was interested in giving a workshop. I felt a sense of responsibility to pass on what I knew and try my best to distill and frame it in an interactive teaching format. 

This seed workshop was a result of that, primarily for use at technology hackathons and nonprofits.

How does a user interact with a company, its web presence, service, communication channels, and its products? How do we create and design a product that is both successful and one that users love?

We’ll explore the basics of user experience design through an interactive, idea-provoking format, including design thinking and its application in the real world. You'll also have the opportunity to apply your learning to a mini case study in Figma during and after the workshop. No prior experience is required! This is aimed at beginner and intermediate learners. 

This workshop is split into two parts 1) Background and basics 2) Mini project. 

*Disclaimer: we aren’t able to develop our design thinking as maturally as we would ideally want to during the workshop! please add more to your work after the workshop!*
