# Intro to UX Workshop 

How does a user interact with a company, its web presence, service, communication channels, and its products? How do we create and design a product that is successful and one that the user would love? Weâ€™ll explore the basics of user experience design through an interactive, idea-provoking format, design thinking, how it is shown in the real world, and applying your learning to a mini-project in Figma during the workshop. 

## Prerequisites 

Please be sure to create a Figma account before the workshop. No prior experience is required! 

## Recordings 

TBD.
