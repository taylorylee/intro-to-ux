# Intro to UX Workshop 

How does a user interact with a company, its web presence, service, communication channels, and its products? How do we create and design a product that is successful and one that the user would love?

We’ll explore the basics of user experience design through an interactive, idea-provoking format, design thinking, how it is shown in the real world, and applying your learning to a mini case study in Figma during and before the workshop. No prior experience is required! This is aimed at beginner and intermediate learners. 

This workshop is split into two parts 1) Background and basics 2) Mini project. 

*Disclaimer: we aren’t able to develop our design thinking as maturally as we would ideally want to during the workshop! please add more to your work after the workshop!*  

## Prerequisites 

**Organization:** Please be sure to create a Figma account before the workshop. Please be prepared to do some prep work beforehand. 

**Hackathon:** Nothing!

**For everything:** 

* If you cannot do any prep work or register later, do not worry about it!

* Since the workshop is interactive, please join in a place where you can both speak/hear, and also where you can use video (bandwidth permitting)  No prior experience is required!

## Recordings

## Future iterations 

We can tailor a few slides to your organization or what you are hoping to do for your event. However, the general structure/overview will most likely stay the same!
